# Sidekick Presentation Framework
---------------------------------
This is a framework that attempts to establish a consistent architecture for presentation/i-vis type applications sharing similar requirements in layout, function and structure. The code base is split into sections that define a set of features relevant to the scope of the section. The lowest level consists of a basic sliding carousel which manages basic swipe/drag interactivity and transition between individual slides. Slides themselves are represented as individual object instances which can hold custom data unique to that slide. Extending this basic carousel is a generic project structure which manages and handles multiple sections with multiple slides, linking navigation to slide management on a presentation level, initialization and project status caching. This is wrapped by a broader API known as Wingman that is extendable to include more abstract, generalized tasks.
